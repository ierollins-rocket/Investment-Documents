# Investment-Documents

Trust is earned and not freely given.

It's with this spirit, we've created this GitHub repo to make our investment documents publicly accessible under [open source license] and to ensure they evolve with the needs of our entrepreneurs and investors. 

In this repo you'll find:

* [Convertible Notes](https://github.com/ierollins-rocket/Investment-Documents/blob/master/Convertible%20Note) **template under construction**

* [Series Seed](https://github.com/ierollins-rocket/Investment-Documents/blob/master/Series%20Seed) equity templates based on Fenwick's Series Seed documents that have been open-sourced for nearly a decade

* [SAFE side letter](https://github.com/ierollins-rocket/Investment-Documents/blob/master/SAFE) to include pro rata rights on future convertible securities, request basic information rights, and financing thresholds to protect against dilution

* [Pro Rata side letter](https://github.com/ierollins-rocket/Investment-Documents/blob/master/Pro%20Rata%20Side%20Letter)( to ensure ability to maintain ownership stake by investing in startup's future fundraising rounds

-[Diversity Rider] to codify our commitment as a co-investor and check-writer for inclusion in financings
